Automatically changes your WordPress site content links for unregistered users by dynamically changing the link target.

== Description ==

The <a href="http://www.presspixels.com">Press Pixels</a> <a href="http://www.presspixels.com/release/dynamic-registration-links/">Dynamic Registration Links</a> Plugin for WordPress helps your site manage “registered members only site content” through forcing registration in links for users that are not logged into your WebSite. When an unregistered site user clicks a dynamic registration link they are directed to your pre-specified redirect link, then once logged in the same link will return back to its original link.

As an example this can be used for a download link – forcing site users to register and login on your site to download the file. This is highly beneficial for SEO purposes as you do not need to block entire site pages from unregistered users, just the link is altered – which allows search engines to still index your pages.

This is done dynamically through Javascript which picks up a specific class placed on any link on your site, add the <strong>class=”authenticatelink”</strong> on any link in content text in a widget, post, page, excerpt or even in your site comments. These links will now force login if user is not logged in, if a user is logged in the link will remain with its original link address.
